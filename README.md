## App Brainstorming

Favorite apps:
1. Instagram (versatility with content, can share many media, can go private and revise stats)
2. TikTok (quick and easy to record videos and edit, many filters, personalized algorithm)
3. Slack (creates gifts easily with pictures, easy to organize sections and channels, good for communication)
4. Youtube (free music listening and interactivity)
5. Linkedin (good for networking, personalized algorithm, easy to use and search filters)

My ideas:
-Personalized algorthim(ML)
-Video and pcture sharing/recording/editing
-Comments can be added to an image

1. Social Fitness & Challenge App: "ChallengeMe"
Problem Tackled: Encouraging fitness and mental well-being among students.
ML Application: Predictive insights based on workout history, student activity patterns, and fitness goals.

App Idea:
A social fitness app that allows users to join fitness challenges, track their progress, and share achievements with friends. It could be structured around the 75-day challenge, where users complete daily fitness and mental resilience tasks. Each day, users have to log their activities (workout, reading, hydration, journaling), and based on their data, the app uses ML to:

Personalize Challenges: Suggest customized challenges based on the user's progress, fitness level, and preferences.

Progress Prediction: Uses historical data to predict the likelihood of completing the challenge, offering motivational insights to keep users engaged.

Social Sharing & Commenting: Allow users to share their progress, photos, or tips, and comment on friends’ posts. ML can recommend who to follow based on shared activities or goals.

Leaderboard & Gamification: A social leaderboard where users can compete with friends or join public groups to compete in various challenges.

Use of Data/ML:

Collect data on user behavior, progress, and workout routines.

ML can suggest tailored workout plans or reading lists for users based on past patterns (like suggesting new books based on genres they prefer).

Provide insights on whether the user is likely to complete the challenge based on their past performance, and offer personalized encouragement.

2. Book and TV Show Recommendation App: "MindFuel"
Problem Tackled: Helping students find books and shows that improve mental health, knowledge, and personal growth.
ML Application: Recommend content based on interests, mood, and goals.

App Idea:
An app that suggests books, TV shows, and podcasts based on the user’s current mood or interests. You could integrate social features where students can comment, share, and discuss the content they’re reading or watching. Users could input their current mood (stress, boredom, motivation, etc.), and the app would use ML to recommend:

Books (e.g., self-improvement, fiction, non-fiction, etc.)

TV Shows/Movies (e.g., motivational, educational, etc.)

Podcasts (on topics like fitness, productivity, mental health)

Use of Data/ML:

Use user input (mood, preferences, goals) to create personalized recommendations.

Allow users to rate books/shows and leave comments. The app learns from these ratings to improve recommendations.

Integrate with databases to track content preferences and usage patterns, constantly refining the suggestions.
